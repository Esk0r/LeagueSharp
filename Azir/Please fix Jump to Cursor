Hello Kortatu,


Sorry for posting a request this way but you don't have forum threads for your scripts so I didn't know how else to 
ask for a fix. Your Azir is the only decent working Azir script at the moment. 

The bindable Jump to Cursor function doesn't work on it.

Can you fix this, please?


Thank you!
